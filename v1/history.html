        <h5>Trambisera Marmi srl was founded in 1974 by Mauro Biagi, who had also been the former co-founder of Biagi Mauro sas in 1955.<br>
        In the Italian quarry, in Seravezza, Tuscany (LU), within an area known as Trambiserra, “open-air” cultivation is used, where planning and technology are currently enabling the realization of rough blocks, improving the production of such blocks in quantity as well as in quality.<br>
        All is done in compliance with #environmental and #safety standards.
        Within the quarry, the following materials are currently extracted:
